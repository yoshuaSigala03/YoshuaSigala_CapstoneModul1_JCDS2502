# Hospital Patient CRUD App

## Overview

The **HHospital Patient CRUD App** is a Python-based application designed to manage patient data efficiently. This system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, patient searches, payment calculations, and provides essential information about hospital departments, diseases, and patient statuses. The application uses the `tabulate` library to present data in a readable tabular format.

## Features

### **1. Create Patient Data**
- Add new patients to the database.
- Ensures no duplicate `Patient ID` is created.
- Provides options to input patient details like name, age, gender, diagnosis, disease type, severity, department, and status.

### **2. Read Patient Data**
- View all patient records in a tabular format.
- Retrieve specific patient data by their unique `Patient ID`.

### **3. Update Patient Data**
- Update details of an existing patient.
- Allows editing only the required fields while keeping the rest unchanged.

### **4. Delete Patient Data**
- Remove a patient's data from the database using their `Patient ID`.
- Includes confirmation prompts before deletion.

### **5. Search Patient Data**
- Search for patients by specific fields, such as `Patient ID`, `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Diagnosis`, `Disease Type`, `Severity`, `Department`, or `Status`.

### **6. Calculate Payment**
- Automatically calculates the total payment due for a patient based on:
  - Disease type (`Infectious` or `Non-Infectious`).
  - Disease severity (`Acute`, `Chronic`, or `Progressive`).
  - Hospital department (`General Medicine`, `Cardiology`, `Pulmonology`, `Neurology`, `Oncology`).
  - Patient status (`Inpatient` or `Outpatient`).
- Displays a detailed breakdown of the costs.
- Supports payment processing and returns change if applicable.

### **7. Display Information**
- Provides detailed explanations of fields, disease types, severity levels, hospital departments, and patient statuses.

### **8. Exit**
- Safely exit the application.
